# Programming-Practices

## About
This repo contains personal notes I've gathered throughout my coding experiences.  The notes are a bit messy right now, organized in different directories.  In addition, the Exercises directory contains practice questions.  I try to only use vanilla Javascript to complete these coding challenges.

## Organization
### Exercises/
The main exercises are located within the Exercises directory.

### javascript-notes/
These contain an accumulation of javascript notes, including sections on datastructures

## Code Challenge List inside Exercises directory:
### practice.js
 1. FizzBuzz
 2. Determine Fibonacci sequence

### fibonacci.js
Listing out fibonacci sequence

### reverse-string.js
Using the JavaScript, have the function FirstReverse(str) take the str parameter
being passed and return the string in reversed order.

### change-string folder
Create a web page that allows a user to input a string, select a text transformation (listed below), and click a button to display the output in a second text field.

Text transformation options for users:
1. Reverse the input
2. Change to uppercase
3. Change to lowercase
4. Remove vowels
5. Replace vowels with numbers
